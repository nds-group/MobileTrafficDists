# Session-level traffic statistics and models

This page contains the coefficients obtained on the work ***Characterizing and Modeling Session-Level Mobile Traffic Demands from Large-Scale Measurements***, presented at ACM IMC 2023. We also present a example on how to generate samples. We present models for 30 different services observed at the production network of a large mobile operator in France, with all values representing transport layer session-level statitics.
