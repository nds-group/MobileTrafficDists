# Session-level traffic statistics and models

This page contains the coefficients obtained on the work ***Characterizing and Modeling Session-Level Mobile Traffic Demands from Large-Scale Measurements***, presented at ACM IMC 2023. We also present a example on how to generate samples. We present models for 30 different services observed at the production network of a large mobile operator in France, with all values representing transport layer session-level statitics.

## Models included

Here's a brief description on what's included on this page. 

### 1. Share of sessions and traffic across apps:
For every app, what was the percentage of sessions and traffic

### 2. Session arrival rate distribution
Considering all antennas included on our study, we present 10 sampled ones ranked by their traffic load, with $0.1$ having the lowest load and $1.0$ the highest
